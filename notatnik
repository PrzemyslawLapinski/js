Big world:
syntax parser - read code and check grammar is valid and transalte to computer instraction
lexical environment - where something sits physically in the code you write,  (where written and what surrounds it)
execution context - a wrapper to help manage the code that is running. there are lots of lexical environments, Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts.
name/value pair - a name which maps to a unique value, the name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context
address = '100 Main St.'
object - a collection of name/value pairs name : {name : {name : 'janusz'}} -> name.name.name
global execution context - this = Global Object(window)
global - not inside a function
synchronous - one at a time, js is synchronous
